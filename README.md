# Personal Finance Dashboard

This project is my take on building a **professional, premium-looking finance dashboard** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It’s designed to simulate a modern banking/finance-style app with interactive features:

- **Dashboard Metrics** → Quick overview of transactions, account balance, and projects.  
- **Transactions Page** → Displays credits and debits in a clean, tabular format with dynamic edit/delete functionality.  
- **Analytics Page** → Live charts powered by Chart.js to visualize transaction data.  
- **Calculator Page** → A functional calculator for quick calculations.  
- **Contact Page** → Basic form setup for user interaction.

You can view the live version here: [Live Site on GitHub Pages](https://yourusername.github.io/luxfinance/)

##  What I’ve Done So Far
- Built a **multi-page structure** with navigation between Dashboard, Transactions, Analytics, Calculator, and Contact pages.  
- Added **dynamic transaction management** with JavaScript, allowing adding, editing, and deleting transactions.  
- Styled the project with a **dark, VIP-inspired theme** for a polished, premium look.  
- Implemented **live charts** with Chart.js for interactive data visualization.  
- Created a functional **calculator script** ready for more advanced operations.  
- Prepared the project for **GitHub Pages deployment**, making it accessible online.

##  What’s Still To Do
- Implement **backend or persistent storage** so transactions are saved across sessions (currently in-memory only).  
- Refine the **calculator JS** for advanced operations and cleaner code.  
- Enhance the **contact page** with validation, backend integration, or email notifications.  
- Improve **animations and transitions** for smoother user interactions.  
- Optimize CSS further to ensure backgrounds, layouts, and responsiveness are fully polished.

##  Why I’m Building This
The main purpose of this project is to:  
1. **Practice** real-world HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.  
2. **Learn by doing** – applying concepts, debugging issues, and iterating independently.  
3. Create a **foundation to expand** later with backend integration, improved analytics, and advanced UI features.

##  How This Helps Me Improve
- Working with **dynamic DOM rendering** (transactions, tables, charts) improves my JavaScript and data manipulation skills.  
- Styling challenges push me to get better at **professional-level CSS** (backgrounds, spacing, and responsive layouts).  
- Building the calculator improves my **logic and problem-solving skills**.  
- Planning pending features trains me to **think ahead** like a real developer.  
- Deploying the site early builds confidence with **version control, GitHub, and live deployment**.

---

## Next Steps
- Integrate **backend or persistent storage** for transaction data.  
- Add advanced **calculator functionality** and data validation.  
- Enhance analytics and visuals with more **charts and filters**.  
- Iterate on UI/UX for a **fully polished premium experience**.  
- Keep the project evolving alongside my skills and learning journey.
